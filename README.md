# Torrentio Debrid Proxy for Stremio

This Stremio addon proxies Real-Debrid streaming links from your configured Torrentio instance through your own server. This means Real Debrid will see the same IP address for all streams from all your clients.

It also caches resolved Real-Debrid stream URLs to improve loading times for subsequent requests and reduce requests on the Torrentio API. Note: Sometimes RD connections can hang open, but it shouldn't affect performance. Let me know if it happens to you.

## Usage in Stremio

Once the addon server is running and accessible at your `PROXY_SERVER_URL`:

1.  Open Stremio.
2.  Go to the Addons section.
3.  In the search bar (or "Install Addon from URL" field), paste the manifest URL for this proxy addon:
    `{{PROXY_SERVER_URL}}/manifest.json`
    (Replace `{{PROXY_SERVER_URL}}` with the actual URL you configured, e.g., `https://stremio-proxy.yourdomain.com/manifest.json` or `http://your.server.ip:13470/manifest.json`)
4.  Click "Install".

Stremio will now fetch movie/series stream information from this proxy, which in turn fetches from your configured Torrentio and rewrites Real-Debrid links to go through this proxy.

## How It Works

1.  You install this addon in Stremio using `{{PROXY_SERVER_URL}}/manifest.json`.
2.  When you select a movie or series in Stremio, Stremio requests stream information from this addon (e.g., `{{PROXY_SERVER_URL}}/stream/movie/tt123456.json`).
3.  This addon forwards the request to your configured `TORRENTIO_URL` to get the list of available streams.
4.  For each stream that is a Real-Debrid link, this addon rewrites the URL:
    *   Original RD link (example): `https://torrentio.strem.fun/realdebrid/......`
    *   Rewritten link: `{{PROXY_SERVER_URL}}/realdebrid/......`
5.  When Stremio tries to play a rewritten link:
    *   It requests `{{PROXY_SERVER_URL}}/realdebrid/......`.
    *   This addon first resolves the actual Real-Debrid direct file URL from `https://torrentio.strem.fun/realdebrid/......`. This resolved URL is cached.
    *   Then, this addon proxies the video data from the resolved Real-Debrid URL directly to your Stremio client. All streaming traffic from Real-Debrid now passes through your server where this addon is hosted. Real-Debrid will only see a single IP, regardless of the client.
    *   
## Prerequisites

*   A [Real-Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/) account.
*   An existing Torrentio addon configuration (you'll need its URL).
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) (recommended for easy setup) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if building from source).

## Setup

You need to configure the following environment variables:

### 1. `PROXY_SERVER_URL`
The publicly accessible URL where this addon will be running. Stremio clients must be able to reach this URL.

- **Example:**  
  `https://stremio-proxy.yourdomain.com`

---

### 2. `TORRENTIO_URL`
Your personalized Torrentio addon URL.

- **How to obtain it:**
  1. Go to the Torrentio configuration page (e.g., `https://torrentio.strem.fun`).
  2. Configure it with your Real-Debrid API key and preferred settings.
  3. Right-click the **Install** button and choose **Copy Link Address**. This becomes your `TORRENTIO_URL`.

---

### 3. `API_KEY` (Optional)
If set, all incoming requests must include this key as a query parameter:  
`?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`

- All outgoing stream URLs generated by the addon will automatically include the `api_key` parameter.
- This helps prevent unauthorized use of your proxy.

> **Important:**  
> If you use `API_KEY`, you must remove and re-add the addon to Stremio using the following format:  
> `{PROXY_SERVER_URL}/manifest.json?api_key={yourkey}`

- **Example:**  
  `API_KEY=mysecurekey`  
  Addon URL:  
  `https://stremio-proxy.yourdomain.com/manifest.json?api_key=mysecurekey`


### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

I've provided a Docker image for easy deployment.

#### A. Bare Bones Docker Compose (No VPN, No Tunnel)

This setup exposes the addon directly on port 13470. You'll need to ensure this port is accessible and `PROXY_SERVER_URL` points to your server's IP/domain and this port (e.g., `http://your.server.ip:13470`). This is untested.

Note: Any stremio clients needs to be able to access the PROXY_SERVER_URL for this to work. i.e. If its a local IP you're hosting the proxy on, you'll only be able to access it within that network or via VPN/Tailscale etc.

`docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  torrentio-debrid-proxy:
    image: ghcr.io/irrelevantsoftware/torrentiodebridproxy:latest # Replace with your actual image if self-built
    container_name: torrentio-debrid-proxy
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - PROXY_SERVER_URL={{YOUR_PROXY_URL}} # e.g., http://your.server.ip:13470 or https://your.domain.com
      - TORRENTIO_URL={{YOUR_TORRENTIO_URL}} # Your configured Torrentio URL
      # - PORT=13470 # Optional: Change if port 13470 is already in use
    ports:
      - "13470:13470" # Exposes the addon on port 13470 (or your custom PORT)
```
Replace `{{YOUR_PROXY_URL}}` and `{{YOUR_TORRENTIO_URL}}` with your actual values.
Then run: `docker-compose up -d`

#### B. Docker Compose with Gluetun VPN and Cloudflare Tunnel

This setup routes the addon's traffic through Gluetun VPN (so Real-Debrid sees the VPN IP, not your server IP) and exposes the addon via a Cloudflare Tunnel, allowing your remote Stremio clients to access it on any network.

NOTE: Depending on your Cloudflare Tunnel setup, this method exposes the addon server publicly - be mindful of your network security.

`docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  # Stremio Addon
  torrentio-debrid-proxy:
    image: ghcr.io/irrelevantsoftware/torrentiodebridproxy:latest # Replace with your actual image if self-built
    container_name: torrentio-debrid-proxy
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - PROXY_SERVER_URL={{YOUR_TUNNEL_HOSTNAME}} # e.g., https://stremio-proxy.yourdomain.com (from Cloudflare Tunnel)
      - TORRENTIO_URL={{YOUR_TORRENTIO_URL}} # Your configured Torrentio URL
      - API_KEY={SECURE_KEY}
      # - PORT=13470 # Optional: Internal port for the addon
    network_mode: "service:gluetun" # Routes traffic through Gluetun
    depends_on:
      - gluetun

  # Gluetun VPN
  gluetun:
    container_name: "gluetun"
    image: qmcgaw/gluetun
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    devices:
      - /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun
    ports: # Only needed if you want to access other services through Gluetun directly, not for this addon's primary function
      - 13470:13470/tcp # Expose the addon's port through Gluetun for Cloudflared
    environment:
      - VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER= # e.g., nordvpn, mullvad, custom
      - VPN_TYPE=wireguard # or openvpn
      # Add your VPN provider specific credentials below
      # For Wireguard:
      - WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY=...
      - WIREGUARD_ADDRESSES=... # e.g., 10.66.169.2/32
      # For OpenVPN:
      # - OPENVPN_USER=...
      # - OPENVPN_PASSWORD=...
      - SERVER_COUNTRIES=... # e.g., Netherlands, Switzerland
    restart: unless-stopped

  # Cloudflare tunnel to expose PROXY_SERVER_URL
  cloudflared:
    container_name: cloudflared
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: tunnel run
    environment:
      - TUNNEL_TOKEN={{CF_TUNNEL_TOKEN}} # Your Cloudflare Tunnel token
    depends_on:
      - gluetun # Ensure Gluetun is up before Cloudflared tries to connect
    network_mode: "service:gluetun" # So Cloudflared can reach the addon via gluetun's network
                                    # Cloudflare Tunnel service should point to http://localhost:13470
                                    # (or http://gluetun:13470 if using default Docker networking and not network_mode:service:gluetun)
                                    # *Correction*: If cloudflared is in network_mode: service:gluetun,
                                    # it will resolve 'localhost' as gluetun itself.
                                    # The service in your Cloudflare Tunnel dashboard should be: http://localhost:13470
                                    # (assuming the addon is listening on port 13470 within the Gluetun network namespace)
```
**Important Notes for Gluetun + Cloudflare setup:**
1.  Replace `{{YOUR_TUNNEL_HOSTNAME}}`, `{{YOUR_TORRENTIO_URL}}`, and `{{CF_TUNNEL_TOKEN}}` with your actual values.
2.  Configure Gluetun with your VPN provider's details.
3.  In your Cloudflare Tunnel configuration (Zero Trust Dashboard), create a public hostname (this will be your `PROXY_SERVER_URL`) and point its service to `http://gluetun:13470` (or `http://localhost:YOUR_CUSTOM_PORT` if you changed the `PORT` environment variable for `torrentio-debrid-proxy`).

Then run: `docker-compose up -d` and add the addon to Stremio via {PROXY_SERVER_URL}/manifest.json?api_key={SECURE_KEY}

NOTE: Depending on your Cloudflare Tunnel setup, this method exposes the addon server publicly - be mindful of your network security.
